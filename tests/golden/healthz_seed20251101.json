      "Use deterministic random seed + UUIDv4 identifiers for each person.",
      "Select driver_license_state from the governed western region list (CA/AZ/NV/OR/WA).",
      "Generate postal_code values that stay within curated ranges for each state.",
      "Populate address_line_2 for every third record to validate optional-field logic.",
      "Weight lob_type assignments toward Personal (70%) while keeping Commercial coverage.",
      "Each Person receives one vehicle in v0.1 to guarantee referential integrity.",
      "VINs are composed of governed characters (17 chars, excluding I/O/Q).",
      "Model years range from 2008 through 2024 to reflect late-model fleets.",
      "Body style + risk rating distributions change with the owning Person's lob_type.",
      "Garaging state/postal code mirror the owning Person's address to keep datasets coherent."
