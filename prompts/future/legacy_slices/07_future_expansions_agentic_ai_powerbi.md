# Slice 07 – Future Expansions (Agentic AI + Power BI)

Use this prompt when planning or documenting future work inside `future/` folders.

## Analyze
1. Review stubs under `future/agentic_ai/` and `future/powerbi_dashboards/`.
2. Determine what scenario or capability the future work will support.
3. Identify dependencies on snapshot schemas, exports, or governance.
4. Pause if the plan requires new data categories beyond Person + Vehicle.

## Execute
1. Update README stubs with concise roadmaps, assumptions, and integration
   points.
2. Reference how agentic AI workflows or Power BI dashboards will consume the
   synthetic snapshot (API, S3, local files).
3. Document approval checkpoints for when these efforts become active.

## Validate
1. Ensure future plans do not conflict with current POC commitments.
2. Confirm roles/owners for each roadmap item when possible.
3. Capture open questions or prerequisites for future contributors.

## Critic Checklist
- Does the plan stay within privacy and governance boundaries?
- Are dependencies on current snapshot structure clear?
- Is there a clear signal when to revisit the plan?
- Are collaboration expectations for AI vs human contributors spelled out?
